## Project Background

This project is analyzing the gym equipment market to evaluate yearly and monthly profit trends, category, supplier, and brand performance for the gym equipment industry, providing actionable insights and recommendations for sustained growth and profitability.

## Executive Summary

Gym Equipment sales analysis of 1,233 records from years 2018-2024 shows monthly profits, YTD and MAT Profits across 9 gym brands, 3 suppliers (3 brands for each supplier), and 3 categories of gym equipment. 

From 2018 to 2024, Airbikes is the leading gym equipment category with $5.76M total profits (37% market share), noting that 6/9 brands sells airbikes while 5/9 brands sell rowing machines and treadmills. Peak Performance Gear leads supplier profit contributions with $5.77M total (37% market share). Steel Power is the top performing gym brand with $2.88M total profits (19% market share), noting that they are the only brand selling in all 3 categories while the others sell in 1 or 2 categories. 

In 2024 so far, Apex Athletics currently leads the airbikes market share contributing 18% of sales with Peak Performance Gear suppling them; Elevate Fitness leads the rowing machines market share contributing 21% of sales with Peak Performance Gear also suppling them, and Spartan Sports leads the treadmills market share contributing 21% of sales with Iron Strength Equipment supplying them.

Companies can benefit from expanding top product lines, optimizing bundling, and enhancing loyalty fitness programs to increase customer lifetime value. Targeted marketing and sales campaigns in certain monthly peaks throughout the year, along with improvements to digital channels to reach broader audience, will strengthen a companies market position and drive sustainable growth.

## Clarifying Questions, Assumptions, and Caveats

### Questions for Stakeholders Prior to Project Advancement

- **Unmatched `customer_id` Records**
    - Which table should be the primary source for `customer_id` to maintain data consistency across analyses?

- **`marketing_channel` and `account_creation_method` in the `customers` table**
    - How is this data recorded, and what does it specifically represent?
    - What factors contribute to their deterministic relationship?
    - Does `marketing_channel` capture the initial account creation touchpoint, or does it represent the origin of each individual purchase (which is more relevant for tracking sales)?

- **`loyalty_program` in the `customers` table**
    - Is `loyalty_program` account-specific or tied to individual orders?
    - Can loyalty membership status vary between orders for the same user, i.e., is it a subscription or a one-time sign-up?

### Assumptions and Caveats

- **Refund Records**: No refunds were recorded for 2022, which is an anomaly warranting further examination.
- **Deterministic Relationship in Data**: Each `marketing_channel` is uniquely linked to one `account_creation_method`, indicating a one-to-one mapping. This lack of variation may require attention from the data engineering team to confirm intended relationships.
    - ![One to One Mapping](Data/visualizations/order_count_channelxmethod.webp)
- **Loyalty Program Clarification**:
    - Ambiguity exists in the `loyalty_program` variable—it's unclear if it's tied to the user's account or is specific to individual orders.
    - Can a user be a loyalty member for one purchase and not another? This clarification is essential for accurately measuring program performance.
- **Sales and Marketing Channels**: Direct and email channels are top drivers of sales, yet the link between these channels and the loyalty program is uncertain due to deterministic channel-account-order relationships.
    - **Attribution of Purchases to Channels**: Ideally, each purchase would be attributed to the marketing channel that directly led to it, rather than defaulting all future purchases to the initial channel. However, the current dataset reflects the entry point at account creation, not at individual purchase. Despite this, the data provides insights on loyalty membership by channel:
        - **Email Channel**: Highest loyalty membership rate at 58%.
        - **Direct Channel**: Largest loyalty membership count, with 32,906 members (72% of all loyalty members).
    - These metrics could inform strategic channel emphasis to boost loyalty engagement.
- **Unmatched Customer Records**: Approximately 27k (25%) of transactions have `customer_id`s not present in the `customers` table. This discrepancy suggests missing data or data entry errors, impacting SQL queries and resulting in NULLs when joining on `customer_id`.
    - This issue arises from the segmented structure of SQL tables (`orders`, `customers`, `geo_lookup`, `order_status`). However, in Excel, where all data resides in a single table, this issue doesn't occur.
