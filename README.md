## Recommendations

Capitalize on Monthly Trends

- **Seasonal campaigns**: Focus marketing and inventory efforts on high-profit months (May, August, December).

***

Maximizing Product Offerings

- **Expand High-Performing Categories**: Brands should expand their offerings to include all 3 categories like Steel Power did, which resulted them in performing the best over time.

***

Optimize Supply Chain

- **Work Closely with high-performing suppliers**: Iron Strength Equipment dominates in rowing machines while Peak Performance dominates in Airbikes. For treadmills, you could go with either Peak Performance or Titan Fitness Supply as they have nearly the same market share.
